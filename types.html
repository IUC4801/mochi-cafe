         These coffee beans are either exotic or are grown in our farm.</p>

            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, cursive; color:navy;"><b>Arabica is the most common (and certainly most heavily marketed) type of coffee in North America. That’s because it actually has a sweeter, more delicate flavor and the coffee itself tends to be less acidic. Arabica beans are farmed in areas with high elevations above sea level, particularly those where rain is plentiful. In fact, Brazil, known for its lush rainforest, is the world’s foremost exporter of Arabica beans. The plants themselves are fairly delicate, requiring a fair amount of pruning and constant attention to environmental factors. The Coffee arabica species is particularly prone to disease so farming in great quantities is a challenge. This drives up the cost of the bean considerably in the global market, but many coffee drinkers around the world are happy to pay the difference because of the softer, sweeter taste.</b></p>

            <h2 style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 40px; color: brown;">Robusta</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, cursive; color:navy;"><b>When it comes to global production, Robusta coffee beans are second on the list and the most popular in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Its name does this bean justice, as it is known for its strong and often harsh flavor profile. Robusta coffees have extremely high levels of caffeine, which makes the plant far more resilient than the Arabica species. That’s because the caffeine acts as natural insect repellent, eliminating a major threat to the tree. The coffee caniphora species is also particularly tolerant of its environment, so it can be grown in any number of altitudes and climates. Because of its reputation for tasting burnt or rubbery, robusta is not generally a very popular coffee commodity, except where very strong coffee is a cultural norm. However, because it’s so much easier to grow and harvest than Arabica beans.</b</p>

            <h2 style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 40px; color: brown;">Liberica</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, cursive; color:navy;"><b>Liberica coffee beans are a rare treat. They’re grown in very specific climates with production being far too scarce for farmers to scale their operations to truly satisfy a global marketplace. Even still, the beans are considered a pleasant surprise. Many who’ve tried the coffee liken the aroma to fruit and flowers and describe the flavor as having a somewhat “woody” taste.The Philippines were the first to harvest and sell the Liberica plant at a noteworthy volume and as the sole supplier the nation saw its economy grow tremendously.</b></p>

                <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, cursive; color:navy;"><b>The final type of coffee bean we introduce today is Excelsa. Excelsa is technically a member of the Liberica family, but its species is actually incredibly distinct. Like the Liberica coffee described above, Excelsa is grown primarily in Southeast Asia and represents only a small fraction of the world’s coffee production. Excelsa does boast a tart, fruitier flavor and is known for showing attributes of both light and dark roast coffees to create a unique profile that is frequently sought out by coffee enthusiasts.</b></p>
